          Established shortly after the accident in 1986, the CEZ was initially
          the area within the 30 km radius around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
          Plant, although, the borders have subsequently expanded.<br /><br />The
          Exclusion Zone covers an area of approximately 2,600 km2 (1,000 sq mi)
          in Ukraine immediately surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant
          where radioactive contamination from nuclear fallout is highest and
          public access and inhabitation are restricted. Other areas of
          compulsory resettlement and voluntary relocation not part of the
          restricted exclusion zone exist in the surrounding areas and
          throughout Ukraine.[8] In February 2019 it was revealed that talks
          have been underway to redraw the boundaries of the Exclusion Zone to
          reflect the declining radioactivity of the Zone's outer areas.

          massive steel and concrete structure covering the nuclear reactor
          number 4 building of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It was
          designed to limit radioactive contamination of the environment
          following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, by encasing the most dangerous
          area and protecting it from climate exposure. It was located within a
          large restricted area known as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.<br /><br />

          abandoned farmlands, wetlands, flowing and standing waters, deserted
          villages and urban areas. The Belarusian area (approximately 2200 km2)
          consists mainly of swamps, marshes and peat-bogs. Forest occupies
          about one half of the Belarusian territory; areas not forested are
          mostly former agricultural lands and meadows. Both the Ukrainian and

          villages as well as the town of Chernobyl. This number is in decline,
          down from previous estimates of 314 in 2007 and 1,200 in 1986. These
          residents are senior citizens, with an average age of 63. After
          repeated attempts at expulsion, the authorities have accepted their
          presence and allowed them to stay with limited supporting services.
          Residence is now informally permitted by the Ukrainian government.
          <br /><br />Chernobyl town, located outside of the 10 km Exclusion
          Zone, was evacuated following the accident, but now serves as a base
          to support the workers within the Exclusion Zone. Its amenities
          include administrative buildings, general stores, a canteen, a hotel,
          and a bus station. Unlike other areas within the Exclusion Zone,
          Chernobyl town is actively maintained by workers, such as lawn areas
          being mowed and autumn leaves being collected.<br /><br />

          each year, and there are now daily trips from Kyiv offered by multiple
          companies. In addition, multiple-day excursions can be easily arranged
          with Ukrainian tour operators. Most overnight tourists stay in a hotel
          within the town of Chernobyl, which is located within the Exclusion
          Zone. According to an exclusion area tour guide, as of 2017, there are
          approximately 50 licensed exclusion area tour guides in total working
          for approximately nine companies. Visitors must present their
          passports when entering the Exclusion Zone, and are screened for
          radiation when exiting both at the 10 km checkpoint and at the 30 km
          checkpoint. The Exclusion Zone can also be entered if an application
          is made directly to the zone administration department.<br /><br />
